# Gopherbot Base Containers

This repository is used to build Gopherbot's base containerfiles; these form the base of:
* `quay.io/lnxjedi/gopherbot:min` - minimal container for running Gopherbot with Python3 and Ruby
* `quay.io/lnxjedi/gopherbot:theia` - same as above, adding the Theia web-based code editor
* `quay.io/lnxjedi/gopherbot:dev` - same as above, but using theia as the entrypoint
